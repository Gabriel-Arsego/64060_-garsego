Assignment 1

1 and 2. First I imported the Cereals.csv file from the CSV files on Canvas:
```{R}
Cereals <- read.csv("C:/Users/arseg/Downloads/Cereals.csv")
```
3. Then I printed out descriptive statistics using the summary() function:
```{R}
summary(Cereals)
```
I created 2 variables called "meancalories" and "medianfiber" and printed them:
```{R}
meancalories <- mean(Cereals$calories)
meancalories
medianfiber <- median(Cereals$fiber)
medianfiber
```
4. Using the as.factor() function I transformed the "name" variable into a factor:
```{R}
Cereals$name <- as.factor(Cereals$name)
Cereals$name
```
5. I used plot() to plot the variable protein:
```{R}
plot(Cereals$protein)
```

With ggplot() I created the axes for the plot, and with + geom_point() I added
a scatterplot layer. I had to load the ggplot2 library to generate the plot:

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Cereals, aes(calories, weight)) + geom_point()
```
